Deleting a dashboard in Elasticsearch will also delete its dependent objects such as visualizations, index patterns, saved searches, and so on, if they are not shared across other dashboards.

However, if the dependent objects are shared across multiple dashboards, then they will not be deleted when a single dashboard is deleted. Instead, the dependent objects will still exist in Elasticsearch and can be used in other dashboards.
